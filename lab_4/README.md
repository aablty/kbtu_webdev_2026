# Lab 4 - Online Store

## Project Structure

- `online-store/` - Angular frontend application
- `server/` - Express backend server

## Running the Project

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.

### Backend Server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```

The server will start on port 3000 (or configured port).

### Frontend Application

Open a new terminal:

```bash
cd online-store
npm install
npm start
```

The Angular app will start at `http://localhost:4200`.

### Running Both Together

You need to run both the server and the frontend simultaneously in separate terminals.
