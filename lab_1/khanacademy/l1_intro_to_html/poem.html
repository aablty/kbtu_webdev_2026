    <h1>Yours</h1>
    <p>
      I am yours as the summer air at evening is <br />
      Possessed by the scent of linden blossoms, <br /><br />
      As the snowcap gleams with light <br />
      Lent it by the brimming moon. <br /><br />
      Without you I'd be an unleafed tree <br />
      Blasted in a bleakness with no Spring. <br /><br />
      Your love is the weather of my being. <br />
      What is an island without the sea?
